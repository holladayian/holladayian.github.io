# Mod1 Static Comp Challenge

## Overview
This project was designed to teach us how to create a webpage using CSS and HTML. We were given a picture of a webpage as a general model for our own. From here, we were tasked with creating our own page with a similar layout. We were given creative liberty to add our own colors and pictures, but the design had to be the same as the model.
